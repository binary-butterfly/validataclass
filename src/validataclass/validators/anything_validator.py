class AnythingValidator(Validator):
    """
    Special validator that accepts any input without validation.

    This validator can be used in places where it's not possible or necessary to validate the input but where the input
    should still be preserved (e.g. as a field in a dataclass), or where the unvalidated data should be saved and
    properly validated at a later point.

    By default this validator accepts literally anything, including `None`. There are two optional parameters which can
    be used to restrict the validator to some extend: `allow_none` and `allowed_types`.

    To reject `None` as input, but accept anything else, you can set `allow_none=False`.

    To only allow a certain set of input data types, you can set `allowed_types` to a list or set (or any iterable) of
    types. The validator will do a type check on the input data then and reject any types that are not part of
    `allowed_types`. Keep in mind that no further validation will be performed on the data.

    Setting `allowed_types` will also cause the validator to reject `None` unless it is part of the allowed types. For
    example, if you set `allowed_types=[str]`, only strings will be accepted. If you additionally want to allow `None`,
    you can set `allow_none=True`. Alternatively you can also specify `type(None)` or `None` in the allowed types list.

    The validation errors raised by this validator are `RequiredValueError` (only if `allow_none=False` or
    `allowed_types` is used) and `InvalidTypeError` (only if `allowed_types` is used).

    Examples:

    ```
    # Accepts any input and returns it unmodified (including None)
    AnythingValidator()

    # Accepts any input except for None (which raises a RequiredValueError)
    AnythingValidator(allow_none=False)

    # Accepts only integers and floats, which are returned unmodified (None is not allowed)
    AnythingValidator(allowed_types=[int, float])

    # Accepts only None and dictionaries (which are returned completely unvalidated!)
    AnythingValidator(allowed_types=[dict], allow_none=True)
    AnythingValidator(allowed_types=[dict, type(None)])  # same as above
    AnythingValidator(allowed_types=[dict, None])        # same as above, allowed as a shortcut
    ```

    Valid input: Anything (unless restricted by the parameters)
    Output: Unmodified input
    """

    # Whether to allow None as input
    allow_none: bool

    # Which input types to allow (None for anything)
    allowed_types: Optional[List[type]]

    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        allow_none: Optional[bool] = None,
        allowed_types: Union[Iterable[Union[type, None]], type, None] = None,
    ):
        """
        Creates an `AnythingValidator` that accepts any input.

        The optional `allowed_types` parameter can be specified as any iterable of types (e.g. a list of types). As a
        convenience, a single type can be specified as well (e.g. `allowed_types=[dict]` and `allowed_types=dict` are
        equivalent).

        The default of the `allow_none` parameter depends on whether `allowed_types` is set. If it's not set, anything
        should be valid input, including None, so the default is True. If `allowed_types` is set, `allow_none` will
        default to `True` if `type(None)` is part of `allowed_types`, and `False` otherwise.

        If you set both `allow_none` and `allowed_types` explicitly, `allow_none` takes precedence. This means that if
        you set `allow_none=True`, `type(None)` will be automatically added to `allowed_types`. If you set it to
        `False`, the `NoneType` will be automatically removed from `allowed_types` (if it was specified in the first
        place).

        Parameters:
            `allow_none`: Boolean, whether to allow None as the input value (default: depends on context, see above)
            `allowed_types`: One or multiple types, specifies allowed input types (default: `None`, allow any type)
